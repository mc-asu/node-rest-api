npm i --save-dev mocha chai

mocha is inserted in the scripts and expects a "test" folder
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha",
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  },

chai is imported in the "test".js file

const expect = require('chai').expect
const should = require('chai').should()
const assert = require('chai').assert

In this project, we will use the expect interface

Testing code with DB functions: see auth-controller 
Strategy 1: stub or mock the parts that rely on DB access
Strategy 2: create a Test DB - very realistic environment

// Runs multiple times before every "it"
beforeEach(function() {})
// Runs multiple times before after "it"
afterEach(function() {})

Splitting large functions is good for testing - makes it easier
